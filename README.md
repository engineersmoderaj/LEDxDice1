# LEDxDice1
This project simulates a dice roll using an Arduino, LEDs, and a push button. When the button is pressed, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated, and the corresponding LED lights up to display the result. The project features a fun tension-building effect before revealing the dice outcome.
